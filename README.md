# CS340 - Animal Shelter CRUD and Client

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

One of the main advantages I saw was being able to more easily use the database in such a way to where I can automate it to filter for different data. In the client I was able to create radio buttons that filtered for specific dog breeds for differnt use-cases. In the future that can be expanded with just a few lines of code vs having to manually write them in the command line to see what the user wanted.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach mainly had me consider how I wanted to read the data from my database in such a way to get the information my clients needed. There was a lot of consideration on how to display the data as well. A map along side a graph showing the percentages of dog breeds for a spcific use-case was just as important as the code itself.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

"Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems" (Michigan Technological University, n.d.). Computer scientists focus more on the development of software vs a data scientist who works with the data itself. My role, as a computer scientist, would be to develop the best possible software to interface with the data inside any database my clients have. This would allow them to easily access and manipulate their data in a way that is efficient and user-friendly.
